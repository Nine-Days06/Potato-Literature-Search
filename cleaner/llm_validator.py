    "Title: Molecular cloning of the potato Gro1-4 gene conferring "
    "resistance to pathotype Ro1 of the root cyst nematode Globodera "
    "rostochiensis, based on a candidate gene approach.\n"
    "Abstract: The endoparasitic root cyst nematode Globodera "
    "rostochiensis causes considerable damage in potato cultivation. "
    "In the past, major genes for nematode resistance have been "
    "introgressed from related potato species into cultivars. "
    "Elucidating the molecular basis of resistance will contribute to "
    "the understanding of nematode-plant interactions and assist in "
    "breeding nematode-resistant cultivars. The Gro1 resistance locus "
    "to G. rostochiensis on potato chromosome VII co-localized with a "
    "resistance-gene-like (RGL) DNA marker. This marker was used to "
    "isolate from genomic libraries 15 members of a closely related "
    "candidate gene family. Analysis of inheritance, linkage mapping, "
    "and sequencing reduced the number of candidate genes to three. "
    "Complementation analysis by stable potato transformation showed "
    "that the gene Gro1-4 conferred resistance to G. rostochiensis "
    "pathotype Ro1. Gro1-4 encodes a protein of 1136 amino acids that "
    "contains Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR), nucleotide-binding "
    "(NB), leucine-rich repeat (LRR) homology domains and a C-terminal "
    "domain with unknown function. The deduced Gro1-4 protein differed "
    "by 29 amino acid changes from susceptible members of the Gro1 gene "
    "family. Sequence characterization of 13 members of the Gro1 gene "
    "family revealed putative regulatory elements and a variable "
    "microsatellite in the promoter region, insertion of a "
    "retrotransposon-like element in the first intron, and a stop codon "
    "in the NB coding region of some genes. Sequence analysis of RT-PCR "
    "products showed that Gro1-4 is expressed, among other members of "
    "the family including putative pseudogenes, in non-infected roots "
    "of nematode-resistant plants. RT-PCR also demonstrated that "
    "members of the Gro1 gene family are expressed in most potato "

    "Title: DNA variation at the invertase locus invGE/GF is "
    "associated with tuber quality traits in populations of potato "
    "breeding clones.\n"
    "Abstract: Starch and sugar content of potato tubers are "
    "quantitative traits, which are models for the candidate gene "
    "approach for identifying the molecular basis of quantitative "
    "trait loci (QTL) in noninbred plants. Starch and sugar content "
    "are also important for the quality of processed products such as "
    "potato chips and French fries. A high content of the reducing "
    "sugars glucose and fructose results in inferior chip quality. "
    "Tuber starch content affects nutritional quality. Functional and "
    "genetic models suggest that genes encoding invertases control, "
    "among other things, tuber sugar content. The invGE/GF locus on "
    "potato chromosome IX consists of duplicated invertase genes invGE "
    "and invGF and colocalizes with cold-sweetening QTL Sug9. DNA "
    "variation at invGE/GF was analyzed in 188 tetraploid potato "
    "cultivars, which have been assessed for chip quality and tuber "
    "starch content. Two closely correlated invertase alleles, "
    "invGE-f and invGF-d, were associated with better chip quality in "
    "three breeding populations. Allele invGF-b was associated with "
    "lower tuber starch content. The potato invertase gene invGE is "
    "orthologous to the tomato invertase gene Lin5, which is causal "
    "for the fruit-sugar-yield QTL Brix9-2-5, suggesting that natural "
    "variation of sugar yield in tomato fruits and sugar content of "
    "potato tubers is controlled by functional variants of orthologous "
    "invertase genes.\n\n"

    "Title: Combining ability of highland tropic adapted potato for "
    "tuber yield and yield components under drought.\n"
    "Abstract: Recurrent drought and late blight disease are the "
    "major factors limiting potato productivity in the northwest "
    "Ethiopian highlands. Incorporating drought tolerance and late "
    "blight resistance in the same genotypes will enable the "
    "development of cultivars with high and stable yield potential "
    "under erratic rainfall conditions. The objectives of this study "
    "were to assess combining ability effects and gene action for "
    "tuber yield and traits related to drought tolerance in the "
    "International Potato Centre's (CIP's) advanced clones from the "
    "late blight resistant breeding population B group 'B3C2' and to "
    "identify promising parents and families for cultivar development. "
    "Sixteen advanced clones from the late blight resistant breeding "
    "population were crossed in two sets using the North Carolina "
    "Design II. The resulting 32 families were evaluated together with "
    "five checks and 12 parental clones in a 7 x 7 lattice design with "
    "two water regimes and two replications. The experiment was "
    "carried out at Adet, in northwest Ethiopia under well-watered and "
    "water stressed conditions with terminal drought imposed from the "
    "tuber bulking stage. The results showed highly significant "
    "differences between families, checks, and parents for growth, "
    "physiological, and tuber yield related traits. Traits including "
    "marketable tuber yield, marketable tuber number, average tuber "
    "weight and groundcover were positively correlated with total "
    "tuber yield under both drought stressed and well-watered "
    "conditions. Plant height was correlated with yield only under "
    "drought stressed condition. GCA was more important than SCA for "
    "total tuber yield, marketable tuber yield, average tuber weight, "
    "plant height, groundcover, and chlorophyll content under stress. "
    "This study identified the parents with best GCA and the "
    "combinations with best SCA effects, for both tuber yield and "
    "drought tolerance related traits. The new population is shown to "
    "be a valuable genetic resource for variety selection and "
    "improvement of potato's adaptation to the drought prone areas in "
    "northwest Ethiopia and similar environments.\n\n"

    "Abstract: For studies of differential gene expression in "

    "the synthesis of cDNA from the potato pathogens Erwinia "
    "carotovora subsp. atroseptica (Eca) and Erwinia carotovora "
    "subsp. carotovora (Ecc) using a combination of short "

    "Specific PCR amplifications with primers designed to anneal to "
